# number-guesser
A small Python project where the user has to guess a random number chosen by the program. The program will give hints such as if it is lower, higher, very low, or very high. The user will have a starting score of 100 which goes down depending on how many guesses it takes the player to get the answer. The player can also give up by typing 'END'.
